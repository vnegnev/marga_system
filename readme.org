#+TITLE: MaRGA (MARcos fpGA) System - MaRGA core + RX/TX chains using open-source cores

* Overview

A high-level core containing MaRGA and several open-source DSP cores, connected together internally to form a two-channel RX and TX system. Can be easily implemented in a Vivado project, and requires only a simple block diagram.
